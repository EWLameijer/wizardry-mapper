When having 60 minutes saved...
1. Make a new commit (clean up comments and code as you go)
2. check all code: what is there to do?
3. <8 files in main directory
4. Pass the array in one go (instead of X arguments) to the target MazeManager builder
5. handle the moveNorth and such in the strings!
6. coordinates in cells? [?(0,2) vs (0,2)]
7. Drop-down box for levels (and 10 floors!)
